Good. My checkpoint went pretty smooth. Feels a lot better than last week.

## Day One Daily Qs

**What is the purpose of a Query String?**

Allows you to pass information to and from a website just by adding it to the end of a url. It can be captured by a server and passes something back.

**What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?**

You add a question mark and then a key/value pair. You can distinguish using an ampersand.

**When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?**

They allow in the moment testing and feeback without having to start up Postman or use a front-end.
