## Day Two Daily Qs

**What are the three types of relationships?**
One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many

**What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding**
It doesn't grow the document size. And it allows paginated comments, which embedding doesn't.

**What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?**

You could spend all day linking everything to everything, but its really about the user story and how they will access the data on the frontend. That helps you decided between embedding, linking or using buckets.
