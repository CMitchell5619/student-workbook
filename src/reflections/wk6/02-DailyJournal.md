VUe is different and weird. I like the vertical nature, but it also seems messier in some ways than MVC.

## Day Two Daily Qs

What are props?

Props are essentually a relationship between a parent element and a child element. They work sort of like arguments for functions.

What are props used for?

They are used to pass information down the component tree. This allows the child element to use the information above.

Where can props be used or accessed?

Props can be used by a child element as long as they have been registered. Once they have, they can be accessed directly as if they were in state.
