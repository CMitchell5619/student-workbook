## Day One Daily Qs

**What is Component based architecture?**
It's a method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface. These are called compnents.

**What are some benefits of Component based architecture?**
The project is split vertically. This makes each component easier to work on, as everything pertaining to it is either there, or referenced there. 

**What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?**
On larger projects, each component can itself become messy. If you have a large number of components, the readability suffers.
