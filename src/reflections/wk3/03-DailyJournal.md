## Emotions

Okay, now I'm frustrated. I'm kind of falling behind on how the pattern comes together.

## Day Three Daily Qs

**What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?**

The controller? Or service? The word handler doesn't appear anywhere in the backpack. I'm guessing Get and Set?

**What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?**

Return something. Otherwise nothing happens.

**What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?**

It creates a data objct that is not directly the data we store, but remain manipulatable. Sp? Is that a word?
