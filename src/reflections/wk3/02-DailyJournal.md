## Day Two Daily Qs

**What is the purpose of Encapsulation?**
It bundles data into discreet parts and restricts access from outside the bundle.

**What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?**

It's an easily ignorable convention.

**How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?**

Variables held to a local scope are private.
