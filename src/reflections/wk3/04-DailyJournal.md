Struggle bus. I'm barely keeping up. I think i can do the projects, but I don't really understand what I'm doing or why it works.

## Day Four Daily Qs

**What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?**

**What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?**

**Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.**
