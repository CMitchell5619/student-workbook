## Emotions

We're starting async code. It seems like its not as big a jump as getting into MVC, but everyone says its hard. So i guess I'm ready????!?!?!?

## Day One Daily Qs

**What problem does using exports solve?**

It quarantines the data, so if one area has issues, they're limited by scope.

**How does export differ from export default?**

Export default exports the whole thing, whereas export allows you to send just what you want.

**What is a benefit of using the Module System?**

Having different modules helps keep the data seperate.
