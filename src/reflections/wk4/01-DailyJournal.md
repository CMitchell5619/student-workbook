Not great. My checkpoint is kind of a mess and I'm working on it, but i'm pretty annoyed.

## Day One Daily Qs

**What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?**
The coder is attempting to force the code to run synchronously and the code is getting deep.

**What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?**

Async means that the code is not being ran all at once, top to bottom. Instead, certain functions are running upon completion, or calling back.

**Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell**

Keep your code shallow and use specific names for functions, place code into appropriate modules, and fix errors as they appear.
