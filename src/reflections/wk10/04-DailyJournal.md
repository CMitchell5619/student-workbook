## Day Four Daily Qs

**In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?**

...a column is up and down, while a row is horizontal. So a column is all the things of a type and a row is all the properties of one item.

**Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called characters with the values name, age, description as strings, and an int id.**

-- CREATE TABLE artists(
--   id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
--   name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
--   description VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'This is a description',
--   age INT NOT NULL,

--   PRIMARY KEY (id)
-- );

**What is the difference between the following statements:**
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;

Drop table deletes the whole table, while delete from deletes a row or column.
