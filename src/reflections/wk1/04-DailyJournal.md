## Emotions

I feel much better today. I feel like Bootstrap kinda clicked and I'm moving forward well.

**What is the purpose of wire-framing?**

Wireframing is a mock-up of a potential project, usually for the purpose of demontrating to both shareholders and the dev team itself.

**What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?**

Wireframing can various levels of fidelity, usually referred to as low, mid, and high-fidelity wireframes. 

**Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not**

I think it greatly depends on the scale and scope of the project, its potential expense, and how many people are working on the project. If the project is large, expensive or extensive, it's almost certainly worth creating a wireframe. If it's a small project created by one developer who has a firm handle on the requirements of the project, the time might be better served just pushing forward with the project.
