# Day Three

## Emotions

Pretty frustrated with today. I feel like I was getting the feel for CSS and Bootstrap changes it all. Gonna have to go back and do earlier reading and re-do the Bootstrap Udemy class tonight.

## Day Three Daily Journal

**What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?**
To mock the structure out before getting further involved in any individual portion of a project.

**Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.**

I like to go through Awwwards; the sites may not be hyper efficient, but are very nice in an artistic sense. The other thing I like to do is visit the massive sites that are usually thought of as being purely functional; sites like Amazon or Walmart or even smaller comapanies like Doller General. While these sites might not be beautiful, they are usually very well thought out in terms of user efficiency.

**How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?**

A website is both an artistic expression and a functional tool to provide information or entertainment. Like the mise en scene of a director or the shot composition of a photographer, a website development team controls the focus of the user through the elements the website presents.
