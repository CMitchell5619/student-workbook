## Day Three Daily Qs

**What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?**
They're the consts of C#, but strongly typed. THey allow you to use symbolic names as reference to integral types.

**How can you modify an Enum?**

You can set the value of an enum member. Or you can change the default type of an enum, which by default is int.

**How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)**

Mostly during services and repositories.
