## Emotions

Had a fun day. Weirdly, I think i get vanilla CSS more than Bootstrap right now.

## Day Threee Daily Qs

**What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?**
I've learned to use .log and .error. Log lets you see what data a variable has at a specific point or if areas are talking to each other; error will catch and define errors.

**Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?**
The inspector allows you to see the html and CSS elements. This lets you get a "live" look at your project.

**Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?**
You can add debuggers or tests. The debuggers pause the code at specific points.
