## Day One Daily Qs

**What is Scope?**

Javascript has both a local and a global scope. Let variables inside a function are not visible outside of the function. Var variables can be accessed globally. 

**What is Hoisting?**

Javascript by default moves any declarations to the top of the code; therefore a variable can be invoked before being defined.

**In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?**

Var allows for hoisting. Let has a local scope. And const cannot be changed after set. So usually let is used, as it has a local scope.
