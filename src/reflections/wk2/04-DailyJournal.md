Partner projects are difficult. You don't really agree on the methods, so its harder to plan out your code. Also, i have control issues.

## Day Four Daily Qs

**What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?**
It's so you don't code your way into a corner. It's easy to spend a lot of time working on something that won't be used in the way that you think later and end up wasting a lot of time.

**How do you find answers when you are stuck?**

Google. Stack overflow. MDN. If you're struggling with something, someone else already has.

**From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?**

It's similar to Clean Code. Don't screw over other programmers or especially yourself when you have to come back to something.
