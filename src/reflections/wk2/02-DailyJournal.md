## Day Two Daily Qs

**What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?**

You can outline a function in total. You can write a function in line. And you can write a method that passes to a function.

**What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?**

A parameter is a placeholder. An argument is the information actually being passed in.

**What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?**

A higher order function is a function that uses other functions. They either pass data into another fucntion or rely on it to work at all.,
