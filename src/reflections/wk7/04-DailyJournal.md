## Day Four Daily Qs

**Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?**

Partner programming, ux and documentation. 

**What went well?**

ALmost none of it. The partner programming felt like it slowed things down, our ux is terrible, and it turns out that documenting terrible code doesn't make it better. It's just excuses for why things are pasketti. 

**What would you do differently?**

Honestly? Almost everything, starting in middle school. In terms of coding? I guess understand how to code better.
